explain DOS bootstrap

write to transition matrix and histogram files
read in transition matrix from file

identify relaxation into patterns

make phase diagram

compute:
 configurational entropy
 internal energy
 heat capacity

see how thermodynamics of the network changes if e.g.
 all patterns are close
 all patterns are far away from each other
 patterns are clustered
